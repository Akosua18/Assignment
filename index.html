       <p><u>About me</u></p>
        <p> I am <i>Duodu Akosua Nyarko</i> . A student of the best University in Ghana, <b>KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.</b> This is my first year in the school. I'm basking in the process and trusting <u>God  </u>to  do the rest for me. In life you have to belief in a system ,  the Word of God is the system. Hence I have no fear and i walk with head held high because I know the one who has my back.</p>
